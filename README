===========================================================================

PRRTE is the PMIx Reference Run Time Environment.

The project is formally referred to in documentation by "PRRTE", and
the GitHub repository is "prrte".

However, we have found that most users do not like typing the two
consecutive "r"s in the name. Hence, all of the internal API symbols,
environment variables, MCA frameworks, and CLI executables all use the
abbreviated "prte" (one "r", not two) for convenience.

===========================================================================

When submitting questions and problems, be sure to include as much
extra information as possible.

     https://github.com/openpmix/prrte

The best way to report bugs, send comments, or ask questions is to
post them on the PRRTE GitHub issue tracker:

     https://github.com/openpmix/prrte/issues

Thanks for your time.

===========================================================================

General notes
-------------

- Systems that have been tested are:
  - Linux (various flavors/distros), 32 bit, with gcc
  - Linux (various flavors/distros), 64 bit (x86), with gcc, Intel,
    and Portland (*)
  - OS X (10.7 and above), 32 and 64 bit (x86_64), with gcc (*)

- PRRTE has taken some steps towards Reproducible Builds
  (https://reproducible-builds.org/).  Specifically, PRRTE's
  "configure" and "make" process, by default, records the build date
  and some system-specific information such as the hostname where PRRTE
  was built and the username who built it.  If you desire a
  Reproducible Build, set the $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, $USER and $HOSTNAME
  environment variables before invoking "configure" and "make", and
  PRRTE will use those values instead of invoking "whoami" and/or
  "hostname", respectively.  See
  https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/ for
  information on the expected format and content of the
  $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH variable.

===========================================================================

Quick start
-----------

In many cases, PRRTE can be built and installed by simply
indicating the installation directory on the command line:

$ tar xf prrte-<version>.tar.bz2
$ cd prrte-<version>
$ ./configure --prefix=<path> |& tee config.out
...lots of output...
$ make -j 8 |& tee make.out
...lots of output...
$ make install |& tee install.out
...lots of output...

Note that there are many, many configuration options to the
"./configure" step.  Some of them may be needed for your particular
environmnet; see below for desciptions of the options available.

If your installation prefix path is not writable by a regular user,
you may need to use sudo or su to run the "make install" step.  For
example:

$ sudo make install |& tee install.out
[sudo] password for jsquyres: <enter your password here>
...lots of output...

Finally, note that VPATH builds are fully supported.  For example:

$ tar xf prrte-<version>.tar.bz2
$ cd prrte-<version>
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=<path> |& tee config.out
...etc.

Make today a PRRTE day!
