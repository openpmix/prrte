===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PRRTE since
version 1.0.

2.0.1: 1 Feb 2022
------------------------------------
+**** NOTE: As of v2.0.1, PRRTE no longer has a dependency on "pandoc"
+**** for building and installing man pages.

**** NOTE: PRRTE has identified a bug in HWLOC versions 2.5.0 thru
**** 2.7.0 (inclusive) that causes PMIx to segfault during certain
**** operations. We have worked with the HWLOC developers to fix
**** that problem, and the fix will be included beginning in HWLOC
**** version 2.7.1. Accordingly, PRRTE now checks for the problem
**** HWLOC versions and will error out of configure if they are
**** encountered.

2.0.0: 29 July 2021
------------------------------------
This is the initial production release of the PRRTE software system. It
contains full support of the PMIx v4.1 Standard plus extensions as provided
by OpenPMIx v4.1. It therefore requires support from that release or above.

Delineating all the changes from the original v1.0.0 tarball would be
overwhelming. The original tarball was provided solely as a means for
packagers to prepare for the eventual production version and was not
intended for general use. As expected, the code base has been extensively
revised/rewritten since that time.

Further changes shall be tracked here in follow-on releases.


1.0.0: 17 July, 2019
--------------------

Initial public release.
