===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PRRTE since
version 1.0.

2.0.1: TBD
------------------------------------
PR #1083:
 - Add MCA param to control device distance computation
 - Correctly report --output-directory and --output-filename as deprecated
 - Check for libevent minimum 2.0.21
 - Properly handle generic "orte" MCA params
 - Cleanups associated with IOF operations
 - Avoid use of MCA params for singleton and report-uri
 - autogen.pl: ignore all excluded components
 - Don't allow PRRTE IOF to block during delivery
 - Update ignores to include Coverity working directory
 - Ensure we hold the IOF data until the PMIx library is done with it
 - Add an "unlock" call to balance the code
 - Use correct ninfo when passing into APIs
 - Don't locally output stdout/err if prterun has a parent


2.0.0: 29 July 2021
------------------------------------
This is the initial production release of the PRRTE software system. It
contains full support of the PMIx v4.1 Standard plus extensions as provided
by OpenPMIx v4.1. It therefore requires support from that release or above.

Delineating all the changes from the original v1.0.0 tarball would be
overwhelming. The original tarball was provided solely as a means for
packagers to prepare for the eventual production version and was not
intended for general use. As expected, the code base has been extensively
revised/rewritten since that time.

Further changes shall be tracked here in follow-on releases.


1.0.0: 17 July, 2019
--------------------

Initial public release.
