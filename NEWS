This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PRRTE since
version 1.0.


3.0.0: TBD
------------------------------------
**** NOTE: This release represents a major update to the PRRTE
code base from prior releases. Many of the changes will be
transparent to the user. However, there are a few key areas that
may (likely) impact users. These include:
  * changes to the cmd line interpreter. PRRTE has provided an
    abstraction layer that allows programming library developers
    and environment vendors to customize the cmd line of PRRTE
    binaries (e.g., prterun and prun). This is governed by the
    detection of a "personality" that is to be used for defining
    the cmd line options. The personality can be set either directly
    on the cmd line itself (via the "--personality foo" option) or
    is detected by PRRTE thru the environment.
  * a more extensive "--help" support system.
  * reduction in the "--rank-by" options.
  * addition of new "--output", "--display", and "--runtime-options"
    command line directives
  * removal of the "mindist" mapper due to lack of a maintainer
  * remove of man pages for PRRTE tools - this has been replaced
    with a hierarchical help system. Thus, the command "prun --help"
    will output the former man page for the prun command. Users
    can then access more detailed help on any command line option
    by simply adding it to the help command - i.e., "prun --help <option>"
There are quite a few more changes than listed here, but they mostly
pertain to code internals. However, these dictate that PRRTE v3.0.0
require use of PMIx v4.2.2 or above to compile. Note that this doesn't
impact the PMIx level associated with any applications executed by
PRRTE - the only requirement is that applications link against a
PMIx version that meets the PMIx cross-version requirements (i.e., a
minimum of PMIx v2.5).

2.0.2: 11 Feb 2022
-------------------
**** NOTE: This release contains a workaround that resolves the prior
**** conflict with HWLOC versions 2.5.0 through 2.7.0 (inclusive).
**** Those versions of HWLOC are now supported.

PR #1197: Cleanup a bit in prep for PMIx v5 release
PR #1195: Remove HWLOC version block
PR #1190: Add missing examples to tarball
PR #1189: Ensure an error gets reported when rankfile fails


2.0.1: 1 Feb 2022
------------------------------------
**** NOTE: As of v2.0.1, PRRTE no longer has a dependency on "pandoc"
**** for building and installing man pages.

**** NOTE: PRRTE has identified a bug in HWLOC versions 2.5.0 thru
**** 2.7.0 (inclusive) that causes PMIx to segfault during certain
**** operations. We have worked with the HWLOC developers to fix
**** that problem, and the fix will be included beginning in HWLOC
**** version 2.7.1. Accordingly, PRRTE now checks for the problem
**** HWLOC versions and will error out of configure if they are
**** encountered.

2.0.0: 29 July 2021
------------------------------------
This is the initial production release of the PRRTE software system. It
contains full support of the PMIx v4.1 Standard plus extensions as provided
by OpenPMIx v4.1. It therefore requires support from that release or above.

Delineating all the changes from the original v1.0.0 tarball would be
overwhelming. The original tarball was provided solely as a means for
packagers to prepare for the eventual production version and was not
intended for general use. As expected, the code base has been extensively
revised/rewritten since that time.

Further changes shall be tracked here in follow-on releases.


1.0.0: 17 July, 2019
--------------------

Initial public release.
