[mbind failure]
PRTE failed to bind internal memory to a specific NUMA node.  This
message will only be reported at most once per process.

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  File:       %s:%d
  Message:    %s
  Severity:   %s
#
[invalid binding_policy]
The specified %s policy is not recognized:

  Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported
one.
#
[redefining-policy]
Conflicting directives for binding policy are causing the policy
to be redefined:

  New policy:   %s
  Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.
#
[deprecated]
The following command line option and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line option:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of PRTE.
Please update to the new syntax.
#
[obj-idx-failed]
PRTE failed to find a cache of a specified type.  This is a highly
unusual error; it may indicate a system configuration error.  This
additional information may be of help:

  Message:     %s
  Cache level: %d
#
[missing-cpulist]
The following binding modifier was given but lacks a required value:

  Modifier: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported
one.
#
[bad-processor-type]
The default CPU list contains an invalid modifier:

  Default CPU list:  %s
  Modifier:  %s

The modifier should indicate the type of CPU being used in the
list - the only valid values are HWTCPUS (for use of hwthreads
as independent CPUs) or CORECPUS (for use of cores as independent
CPUs). Please correct the input.
#
[unrecognized-modifier]
The binding request contains an unrecognized modifier:

  Request: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[bind-to-option]
By default, processes are bound to individual CPUs (either COREs
or HWTHREADs, as defined by default or by user specification for
the job). On nodes that are OVERSUBSCRIBEd (i.e., where the number
of procs exceeds the number of assigned slots), the default is to
not bind the processes.

NOTE: processes from prior jobs that are already executing on a node
are not "unbound" when a new job mapping results in the node
becoming oversubscribed.

Binding is performed to the first available specified object type
within the object where the process was mapped. In other words,
binding can only be done to the mapped object or to a resource
located beneath that object.

An object is considered completely consumed when the number of
processes bound to it equals the number of CPUs within it. Unbound
processes are not considered in this computation. Additional
processes cannot be mapped to consumed objects unless the
OVERLOAD qualifier is provided via the "--bind-to" command
line option.

Note that directives and qualifiers are case-insensitive
and can be shortened to the minimum number of characters
to uniquely identify them. Thus, "L1CACHE" can be given
as "l1cache" or simply as "L1".

Supported binding directives include:

-   NONE does not bind the processes

-   HWTHREAD binds each process to a single hardware
    thread/ This requires that hwthreads be treated
    as independent CPUs (i.e., that either the HWTCPUS
    qualifier be provided to the "map-by" option or
    that hwthreads be designated as CPUs by default).

-   CORE binds each process to a single core. This
    can be done whether hwthreads or cores are being
    treated as independent CPUs provided that mapping
    is performed at the core or higher level.

-   L1CACHE binds each process to all the CPUs in
    an L1 cache.

-   L2CACHE binds each process to all the CPUs in
    an L2 cache

-   L3CACHE binds each process to all the CPUs in
    an L3 cache

-   NUMA binds each process to all the CPUs in a NUMA
    region

-   PACKAGE binds each process to all the CPUs in a PACKAGE

Any directive can include qualifiers by adding a colon (:) and any
combination of one or more of the following to the --bind-to option:

-   OVERLOAD indicates that objects can have more
    processes bound to them than CPUs within them

-   IF-SUPPORTED indicates that the job should continue to
    be launched and executed even if binding cannot be
    performed as requested.
#
[bind-upwards]
Binding is performed to the first available specified object type
within the object where the process was mapped. In other words,
binding can only be done to the mapped object or to a resource
located beneath that object.

The specified binding lies above the mapping object type:

  Mapping level: %s
  Binding level: %s

Please correct the map/bind directives and try again.
