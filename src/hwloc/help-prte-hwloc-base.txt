[mbind failure]

PRRTE failed to bind internal memory to a specific NUMA node.  This
message will only be reported at most once per process.

   Local host: %s
   PID:        %d
   File:       %s:%d
   Message:    %s
   Severity:   %s
#
[invalid binding_policy]

The specified %s policy is not recognized:

   Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported one.
#
[obj-idx-failed]

PRRTE failed to find a cache of a specified type.  This is a highly
unusual error; it may indicate a system configuration error.  This
additional information may be of help:

   Message:     %s
#
[bad-processor-type]

The default CPU list contains an invalid modifier:

   Default CPU list:  %s
   Modifier:  %s

The modifier should indicate the type of CPU being used in the list â€”
the only valid values are HWTCPUS (for use of hwthreads as independent
CPUs) or CORECPUS (for use of cores as independent CPUs). Please
correct the input.
#
[unrecognized-modifier]

The binding request contains an unrecognized modifier:

   Request: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[bind-upwards]

Binding is performed to the first available specified object type
within the object where the process was mapped. In other words,
binding can only be done to the mapped object or to a resource located
beneath that object.

The specified binding lies above the mapping object type:

   Mapping level: %s
   Binding level: %s

Please correct the map/bind directives and try again.
#
[pu-not-found]
Construction of the binding output string failed due to inabilty
to obtain a processor unit object:

  PU number: %u

There will be no impact to your application, so we will continue
but will not be able to output the binding locations.
#
[too-many-sites]
At least one process in your application is bound to too many sites
for us to report in a string. There will be no impact to your application
so we will continue but will not be able to output the binding locations.
