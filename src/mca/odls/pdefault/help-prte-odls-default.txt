[execve error]
PRTE tried to fork a new process via the "execve" system call but
failed.  PRTE checks many things before attempting to launch a
child process, but nothing is perfect. This error may be indicative
of another problem on the target host, or even something as silly as
having specified a directory for your application. Your job will now
abort.

  Local host:        %s
  Working dir:       %s
  Application name:  %s
  Error:             %s
#
[binding generic error]
PRTE tried to bind a new process, but something went wrong.  The
process was killed without launching the target application.  Your job
will now abort.

  Local host:        %s
  Application name:  %s
  Error message:     %s
  Location:          %s:%d
#
[iof setup failed]
PRTE tried to launch a child process but the "IOF child setup"
failed.  This should not happen.  Your job will now abort.

#
[syscall fail]
A system call failed that should not have.  In this particular case,

  Application name:  %s
  Function:          %s
  Location:          %s:%d
#
[memory binding error]

wrong. The process was killed without launching the target
application. Your job will now abort.

  Local host:        %s
  Application name:  %s
  Error message: %s
  Location:  %s:%d
#
