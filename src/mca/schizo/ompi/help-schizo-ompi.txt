#  DEPRECATED OPTIONS
#
[mca]
Syntax: --mca <arg0> <arg1>
where arg0 is the parameter name and arg1 is the parameter value

Pass generic MCA parameters - i.e., parameters whose project affiliation
must be determined by PRRTE based on matching the name of the parameter with defined values
from various projects that PRRTE knows about.

DEPRECATED: This translation can be incomplete (e.g., if  known project adds or changes
parameters) - thus, it is strongly recommended that users use project-specific parameters
such as "prtemca" or "pmixmca".
#
[gmca]
Syntax: --gmca <arg0> <arg1>
where arg0 is the parameter name and arg1 is the parameter value. The "g" prefix
indicates that this parameter is to be applied to _all_ application contexts and
not just the one in which the directive appears.

Pass generic MCA parameters - i.e., parameters whose project affiliation
must be determined by PRRTE based on matching the name of the parameter with defined values
from various projects that PRRTE knows about. This translation can be incomplete (e.g., if
a known project adds or changes parameters) - thus, it is strongly recommended that users
use project-specific parameters such as "prtemca" or "pmixmca".
