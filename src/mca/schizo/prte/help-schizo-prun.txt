                                     allocation and job. Allowed values: allocation, bind, map, map-devel,
                                     topo

   --report-state-on-timeout         Report all job and process states upon timeout
   --stop-on-exec                    If supported, stop each specified process at start of execution
   --stop-in-init                    Direct the specified processes to stop in PMIx_Init
