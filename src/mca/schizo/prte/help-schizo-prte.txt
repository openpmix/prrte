Usage: %s [OPTION]...
Initiate an instance of the PMIx Reference RTE (PRRTE) DVM

The following list of command line options are available. Note that
more detailed help for any option can be obtained by adding that
option to the help request as "--help <option>".

/*****      General Options      *****/

-h|--help                            This help message
-h|--help <arg0>                     Help for the specified option
-v|--verbose                         Enable typical debug options
-V|--version                         Print version and exit


/*****       Debug Options       *****/

   --debug-daemons                   Debug daemons - if not set, the "verbose" setting will be limited to
                                     the DVM controller to reduce clutter
   --debug-daemons-file              Enable debugging of any PRTE daemons used by this application, storing
                                     their verbose output in files
   --leave-session-attached          Do not discard stdout/stderr of remote PRTE daemons
   --test-suicide <arg0>             Suicide instead of clean abort after delay
   --do-not-launch                   Do not actually launch the DVM
   --display                         Comma-delimited list of options for displaying information


/*****      Output Options       *****/

   --output <arg0>                   Comma-delimited list of options that control how output is
                                     generated.Allowed values: tag, timestamp, xml, merge-stderr-to-stdout,
                                     dir=DIRNAME, file=filename. The dir option redirects output from
                                     application processes into DIRNAME/job/rank/std[out,err,diag]. The file
                                     option redirects output from application processes into filename.rank. In
                                     both cases, the provided name will be converted to an absolute path.
                                     Supported qualifiers include NOCOPY (do not copy the output to the
                                     stdout/err streams), and RAW (do not buffer the output into complete
                                     lines, but instead output it as it is received).

                                     current environment; "-x foo=bar" exports the environment variable name

Report bugs to %s
#
[prtemca]
Syntax: --prtemca <arg0> <arg1>
where arg0 is the parameter name and arg1 is the parameter value

Pass a PRRTE MCA parameter
#
[pmixmca]
Syntax: --pmixmca <arg0> <arg1>
where arg0 is the parameter name and arg1 is the parameter value

Pass a PMIx MCA parameter
#
[tune]
File(s) containing PRRTE and PMIx MCA params for tuning DVM and/or application operations.
Parameters in the file will be treated as _generic_ parameters and subject to the
translation rules/uncertainties. See "--help mca" for more information.

Syntax in the file is:

param = value

with one parameter and its associated value per line. Empty lines and lines beginning
with the '#' character are ignored.
#
[no-ready-msg]
Do not print a DVM ready message
#
[daemonize]
Daemonize the DVM daemons and controller into the background
#
[system-server]
Start the DVM as the system server
#
[set-sid]
Direct the DVM daemons to separate from the current session
#
[report-pid]
Printout PID on stdout [-], stderr [+], or a file [anything else]
#
[report-uri]
Printout URI on stdout [-], stderr [+], or a file [anything else]
#
[test-suicide]
Suicide instead of clean abort after delay
#
[default-hostfile]
Specify a default hostfile.

#include#help-schizo-cli#dvm-hostfile
#
[singleton]
ID of the singleton process that started us
#
[keepalive]
Pipe to monitor - DVM will terminate upon closure
#
[launch-agent]
Name of daemon executable used to start processes on remote nodes (default: prted)
#
[max-vm-size]
Maximum number of daemons to start
#
[debug-daemons]
Debug daemon output enabled. This is a somewhat limited stream of information. The
primary use for this option is to ensure that the daemon output streams (e.g., stderr)
remain open after launch, thus allowing the user to see any daemon-generated error
messages. Otherwise, the daemon will "daemonize" itself upon launch, thereby closing
its output streams.
#
[debug-daemons-file]
Debug daemon output is enabled and all output from the daemons is redirected into
files named

   output-prted-<daemon-nspace>-<nodename>.log

to avoid conflict on shared file systems. The files are located in the top-level
session directory assigned to the DVM.

#include#help-schizo-cli#session-dir

#
[leave-session-attached]
Do not discard stdout/stderr of remote PRTE daemons
#
[tmpdir]
Define the root location for the PRRTE session directory tree

#include#help-schizo-cli#tmpdir
#
[prefix]
Prefix to be used to look for RTE executables
#
[noprefix]
Disable automatic --prefix behavior
#
[forward-signals]
Comma-delimited list of additional signals (names or integers) to forward to application
processes ["none" => forward nothing]. Signals provided by default include SIGTSTP,
SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGABRT, SIGALRM, and SIGCONT
#
[allow-run-as-root]
Allow execution as root (STRONGLY DISCOURAGED)
#
[timeout]
Timeout DVM startup if time exceeds the specified number of seconds
#
[x]
Export an environment variable, optionally specifying a value (e.g., "-x foo" exports the
environment variable foo and takes its value from the current environment; "-x foo=bar"
exports the environment variable name foo and sets its value to "bar" in the started
processes; "-x foo*" exports all current environmental variables starting with "foo")
#
[show-progress]
Output a brief periodic report on launch progress
#
[hostfile]
#include#help-schizo-cli#dvm-hostfile
#
[machinefile]
Provide a hostfile (synonym for "hostfile")

#include#help-schizo-cli#dvm-hostfile
#
[host]
#include#help-schizo-cli#dash-host
#
[stream-buffering]
Adjust buffering for stdout/stderr [0 unbuffered] [1 line buffered] [2 fully buffered]
#
[do-not-launch]
Perform all necessary operations to prepare to launch the DVM, but do not actually
launch it (usually used to test mapping patterns)
#
#
#  DEPRECATED OPTIONS
#
[mca]
Syntax: --mca <arg0> <arg1>
where arg0 is the parameter name and arg1 is the parameter value

Pass generic MCA parameters - i.e., parameters whose project affiliation
must be determined by PRRTE based on matching the name of the parameter with defined values
from various projects that PRRTE knows about.

DEPRECATED: This translation can be incomplete (e.g., if  known project adds or changes
parameters) - thus, it is strongly recommended that users use project-specific parameters
such as "prtemca" or "pmixmca".
