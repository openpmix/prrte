[ras-base:no-allocation]
We were unable to find an allocation for this job as required by
setting the "allocation required" flag. Please ensure you have
the necessary allocation before executing again.

If you wish to execute without a provided allocation (e.g., by
providing a user-specified hostfile), please ensure that the "allocation
required" flag is not set. This flag can be set in several forms, so
please check that none of the following exist:

MCA param file: prte_allocation_required = 1
Environment: OMPI_MCA_prte_allocation_required=1
Cmd line: -mca prte_allocation_required 1
#
[ras-sim:mismatch]
The number of topology files and the list of number of nodes
must match - i.e., a number of nodes must be given for each
topology.
#
[ras-base:addhost-not-found]
A request was made to add hosts from a hostfile, but the
file could not be opened for reading:

  File: %s

Please check the filename and try again.
