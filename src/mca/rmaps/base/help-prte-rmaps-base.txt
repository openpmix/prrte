#
[multi-apps-and-zero-np]
PRTE found multiple applications to be launched, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d
slots that were requested by the application:

  %s

Either request fewer procs for your application, or make more slots
available for use.

A "slot" is the PRRTE term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which PRRTE processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, PRRTE defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want PRRTE to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --map-by :OVERSUBSCRIBE option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:no-mapped-node]
There are no allocated resources for the application:
  %s
that match the requested mapping:
  %s: %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly for the
indicated specification.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:no-available-resources]
No nodes are available for this job, either due to a failure to
allocate nodes to the job, or allocated nodes being marked
as unavailable (e.g., down, rebooting, or a process attempting
to be relocated to another node when none are available).
[prte-rmaps-base:all-available-resources-used]
All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.
#
[out-of-vpids]
The system has exhausted its available ranks - the application is attempting
to spawn too many daemons and will be aborted.

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available ranks by
re-configuring with the --enable-jumbo-apps option, and then
re-building the application.
#
[failed-map]
Your job failed to map. Either no mapper was available, or none
of the available mappers was able to perform the requested
mapping operation.

  Mapper result:       %s
  Application:         %s
  #procs to be mapped: %d
  Mapping policy:      %s
  Binding policy:      %s

#
[span-packages-multiple]
Your job failed to map because the resulting process placement
would cause the process to be bound to CPUs in more than one
package:

  Mapping policy:  %s
  Binding policy:  %s
  CPUs/rank:       %d

This configuration almost always results in a loss of performance
that can significantly impact applications. Either alter the
mapping, binding, and/or cpus/rank policies so that each process
can fit into a single package, or consider using an alternative
mapper that can handle this configuration (e.g., the rankfile mapper).
#
[span-packages-cpuset]
Your job failed to map because the resulting process placement
would cause the process to be bound to CPUs in more than one
package:

  Mapping policy:  %s
  Binding policy:  %s
  PE-LIST:         %s

This configuration almost always results in a loss of performance
that can significantly impact applications. Either alter the
mapping, binding, and/or PE-LIST policies so that each process
can fit into a single package, or consider using an alternative
mapper that can handle this configuration (e.g., the rankfile mapper).
#
[unrecognized-policy]
The specified %s directive is not recognized:

  Directive: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the directive is a supported
one.
#
[rmaps:binding-target-not-found]
A request was made to bind to %s, but an appropriate target could not
be found on node %s.
#
[allocation-overload]
A request was made to bind that would require binding
processes to more cpus than are available in your allocation:

   Application:     %s
   #processes:      %d
   Mapping policy:  %s
   Binding policy:  %s

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
#
[rmaps:no-topology]
A mapping directive was given that requires knowledge of
a remote node's topology. However, no topology info is
available for the following node:

  Node: %s

The job cannot be executed under this condition. Please either
remove the directive or investigate the lack of topology info.
#
[rmaps:no-available-cpus]
While computing bindings, we found no available cpus on
the following node:

  Node:  %s

Please check your allocation.
#
[rmaps:cpubind-not-supported]
A request was made to bind a process, but at least one node does NOT
support binding processes to cpus.

Node: %s

PRRTE uses the "hwloc" library to perform process and memory
binding. This error message means that hwloc has indicated that
processor binding support is not available on this machine.

On OS X, processor and memory binding is not available at all (i.e.,
the OS does not expose this functionality).

On Linux, lack of the functionality can mean that you are on a
platform where processor and memory affinity is not supported in Linux
itself, or that hwloc was built without NUMA and/or processor affinity
support. When building hwloc (which, depending on your PRRTE
installation, may be embedded in PRRTE itself), it is important to
have the libnuma header and library files available. Different linux
distributions package these files under different names; look for
packages with the word "numa" in them. You may also need a developer
version of the package (e.g., with "dev" or "devel" in the name) to
obtain the relevant header files.

If you are getting this message on a non-OS X, non-Linux platform,
then hwloc does not support processor / memory affinity on this
platform. If the OS/platform does actually support processor / memory
affinity, then you should contact the hwloc maintainers:
https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc.
#
[rmaps:membind-not-supported]
WARNING: a request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

This is a warning only; your job will continue, though performance may
be degraded.

The provided memory binding policy requires that PRRTE abort the
job at this time.
#
[mapping-too-low]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also given to map to an object level that has less cpus than
requested ones:

  #cpus-per-proc:  %d
  number of cpus:  %d
  map-by:          %s

Please specify a mapping level that has more cpus, or else let us
define a default mapping that will allow multiple cpus-per-proc.
#
[unrecognized-modifier]
The mapping request contains an unrecognized qualifier:

  Request: %s

Please check your request and try again. Remember, multiple
qualifiers must be separated by a colon (':').
#
[invalid-pattern]
The mapping request contains a pattern that doesn't match
the required syntax of #:object

  Pattern: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[cannot-launch]
Although we were able to map your job, we are unable to launch
it at this time due to required resources being busy. Please
try again later.
#
[unsupported-default-modifier]
A %s modifier was provided that is not supported as a default value:

  Modifier:  %s

You can provide this modifier on a per-job basis, but it cannot
be the default setting.
#
[unsupported-default-policy]
A %s policy was provided that is not supported as a default value:

  Policy:  %s

You can provide this policy on a per-job basis, but it cannot
be the default setting.
#
[missing-value]
A %s was given that requires a value, but no value for it was given
or the value is missing the required '=' sign:

  Policy:  %s
  Given:   %s

Please provide a value for this policy, or remove it.

#
[invalid-value]
A %s was given that requires a value, but the provided value is invalid:

  Policy:  %s
  Given:   %s

Please provide a valid value for this policy, or remove it.
#
[rankfile-no-filename]
The request to map processes using a rankfile could not be completed
because the filename of the rankfile was not specified. Please
specify the name of the rankfile.
#
[unrecognized-qualifier]
The %s directive contains an unrecognized qualifier:

  Qualifier: %s
  Valid qualifiers: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the qualifier is a supported one.
#
[unrecognized-directive]
The specified %s directive is not recognized:

  Directive: %s
  Valid directives: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the directive is a supported one.
#
[missing-qualifier]
The %s option contains a directive that is missing a value:

  Directive: %s
  Valid directive: "%s=<value>"

Please check for a typo or ensure that the value is provided.
#
[missing-personality]
PRRTE has hit an internal problem that should never happen - it is
attempting to map a job that lacks an assigned personality.

  Job: %s

Please report this to the PRRTE developers (https://github.com/openpmix/prrte/issues)
#
[unsupported-combination]
A %s policy was provided that is not supported in combination
with the "PE=N" option:

  Policy:  %s

When specifying the number of CPUs to use for each process in a job,
the processes must be bound at the CPU level - either HWThread if
"HWTCPUS" was specified, or CORE. Please remove the bind policy
specification and try again.

#
[redefining-policy]

Conflicting directives for binding policy are causing the policy to be
redefined:

   New policy:   %s
   Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.
