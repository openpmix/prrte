[prte-rmaps-base:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d
slots that were requested by the application:

  %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots
available for use.

A "slot" is the PRRTE term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which PRRTE processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, PRRTE defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want PRRTE to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --map-by :OVERSUBSCRIBE option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested hosts are not included in the current allocation for the
application:
  %s
The requested hosts were:
  %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly using the
--host or --hostfile specification.
[prte-rmaps-base:no-mapped-node]
There are no allocated resources for the application:
  %s
that match the requested mapping:
  %s: %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly for the
indicated specification.
[prte-rmaps-base:nolocal-no-available-resources]
There are no available nodes allocated to this job. This could be because
no nodes were found or all the available nodes were already used.

Note that since the -nolocal option was given no processes can be
launched on the local node.
[prte-rmaps-base:no-available-resources]
No nodes are available for this job, either due to a failure to
allocate nodes to the job, or allocated nodes being marked
as unavailable (e.g., down, rebooting, or a process attempting
to be relocated to another node when none are available).
[prte-rmaps-base:all-available-resources-used]
All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.
#
[out-of-vpids]
The system has exhausted its available ranks - the application is attempting
to spawn too many daemons and will be aborted.

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available ranks by
re-configuring with the --enable-jumbo-apps option, and then
re-building the application.
#
[rmaps:too-many-procs]
Your job has requested a conflicting number of processes for the
application:

App: %s
number of procs:  %d

This is more processes than we can launch under the following
additional directives and conditions:

%s:   %d
%s:   %d

Please revise the conflict and try again.
#
[too-many-cpus-per-rank]
Your job has requested more cpus per process(rank) than there
are cpus in a package:

  Cpus/rank: %d
  #cpus/package: %d

Please correct one or both of these values and try again.
#
[failed-map]
Your job failed to map. Either no mapper was available, or none
of the available mappers was able to perform the requested
mapping operation. This can happen if you request a map type
(e.g., loadbalance) and the corresponding mapper was not built.

  Mapper result:    %s
  #procs mapped:    %d
  #nodes assigned:  %d

#
[unrecognized-policy]
The specified %s directive is not recognized:

  Directive: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the directive is a supported
one.
#
[oversubscribe-conflict]
Conflicting directives for the default oversubscription policy were
given stating that oversubscription was both allowed and not allowed.

Please check that only one policy is defined.
#
[rmaps:binding-target-not-found]
A request was made to bind to %s, but an appropriate target could not
be found on node %s.
#
[rmaps:binding-overload]
A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more
processes than cpus on a resource:

   Bind to:     %s
   Node:        %s
   #processes:  %d
   #cpus:       %d

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
#
[rmaps:no-topology]
A mapping directive was given that requires knowledge of
a remote node's topology. However, no topology info is
available for the following node:

  Node: %s

The job cannot be executed under this condition. Please either
remove the directive or investigate the lack of topology info.
#
[rmaps:no-available-cpus]
While computing bindings, we found no available cpus on
the following node:

  Node:  %s

Please check your allocation.
#
[rmaps:cpubind-not-supported]
A request was made to bind a process, but at least one node does NOT
support binding processes to cpus.

Node: %s

PRRTE uses the "hwloc" library to perform process and memory
binding. This error message means that hwloc has indicated that
processor binding support is not available on this machine.

On OS X, processor and memory binding is not available at all (i.e.,
the OS does not expose this functionality).

On Linux, lack of the functionality can mean that you are on a
platform where processor and memory affinity is not supported in Linux
itself, or that hwloc was built without NUMA and/or processor affinity
support. When building hwloc (which, depending on your PRRTE
installation, may be embedded in PRRTE itself), it is important to
have the libnuma header and library files available. Different linux
distributions package these files under different names; look for
packages with the word "numa" in them. You may also need a developer
version of the package (e.g., with "dev" or "devel" in the name) to
obtain the relevant header files.

If you are getting this message on a non-OS X, non-Linux platform,
then hwloc does not support processor / memory affinity on this
platform. If the OS/platform does actually support processor / memory
affinity, then you should contact the hwloc maintainers:
https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc.

The provided memory binding policy requires that PRRTE abort the
job at this time.
#
[rmaps:no-bindable-objects]
No bindable objects of the specified type were available
on at least one node:

  Node:    %s
  Target:  %s
#
[rmaps:unknown-binding-level]
Unknown binding level:

  Target:  %s
  Cache level:  %u
#
[prte-rmaps-base:missing-daemon]
While attempting to build a map of this job, a node
was detected to be missing a daemon:

  Node:  %s

This usually indicates a mismatch between what the
allocation provided for the node name versus what was
actually found on the node.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:no-objects]
No objects of the specified type were found on at least one node:

  Type: %s
  Node: %s

The map cannot be done as specified.
#
[topo-file]
A topology file was given for the compute nodes, but
we were unable to correctly process it. Common errors
include incorrectly specifying the path to the file,
or the file being generated in a way that is incompatible
with the version of hwloc being used by OMPI.

  File: %s

Please correct the problem and try again.
#
[deprecated]
The following command line options and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line options:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of PRRTE.
Please update to the new syntax.
#
[mismatch-binding]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a conflicting binding
policy was specified:

  #cpus-per-proc:  %d
  type of cpus:    %s
  binding policy given: %s

The correct binding policy for the given type of cpu is:

  correct binding policy:  %s

This is the binding policy we would apply by default for this
situation, so no binding need be specified. Please correct the
situation and try again.
#
[mapping-too-low]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also given to map to an object level that has less cpus than
requested ones:

  #cpus-per-proc:  %d
  number of cpus:  %d
  map-by:          %s

Please specify a mapping level that has more cpus, or else let us
define a default mapping that will allow multiple cpus-per-proc.
#
[unrecognized-modifier]
The mapping request contains an unrecognized qualifier:

  Request: %s

Please check your request and try again. Remember, multiple
qualifiers must be separated by a colon (':').
#
[invalid-pattern]
The mapping request contains a pattern that doesn't match
the required syntax of #:object

  Pattern: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[prte-rmaps-base:oversubscribed]
The requested number of processes exceeds the allocated
number of slots:

  #slots:       %d
  #processes:   %d

This creates an oversubscribed condition that may adversely
impact performance when combined with the requested binding
operation. We will continue, but will not bind the processes.
This warning can be omitted by adding the "overload-allowed"
qualifier to the binding policy.
#
[cannot-launch]
Although we were able to map your job, we are unable to launch
it at this time due to required resources being busy. Please
try again later.
#
[rmaps:no-locale]
The request to bind processes could not be completed due to
an internal error - the locale of the following process was
not set by the mapper code:

  Process:  %s

Please contact the OMPI developers for assistance. Meantime,
you will still be able to run your application without binding
by specifying "--bind-to none" on your command line.
#
[mapping-too-low-init]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also given to map to an object level that cannot support that
directive.

Please specify a mapping level that has more than one cpu, or
else let us define a default mapping that will allow multiple
cpus-per-proc.
#
[device-not-specified]
The request to map processes by distance could not be completed
because device to map near by was not specified. Please, use
rmaps_dist_device mca parameter to set it.
#
[num-procs-not-specified]
Either the -host or -hostfile options were given, but the number
of processes to start was omitted. This combination is not supported.

Please specify the number of processes to run and try again.
#
[failed-assignments]
The attempt to assign hardware locations to processes on a
compute node failed:

  Node:    %s
  Policy:  %s

We cannot continue - please check that the policy is in
accordance with the actual available hardware.
#
[rmaps:insufficient-cpus]
The request to bind processes to cpus in a provided list
of logical id's based on their local rank on a node cannot
be met due to there being more processes on a node than
available cpus:

  Node:         %s
  Local rank:   %d
  Cpu list:     %s

Please adjust either the number of processes per node or
the list of cpus.
#
[unsupported-default-modifier]
A %s modifier was provided that is not supported as a default value:

  Modifier:  %s

You can provide this modifier on a per-job basis, but it cannot
be the default setting.
#
[unsupported-default-policy]
A %s policy was provided that is not supported as a default value:

  Policy:  %s

You can provide this policy on a per-job basis, but it cannot
be the default setting.
#
[missing-value]
A %s was given that requires a value, but no value for it was given
or the value is missing the required '=' sign:

  Policy:  %s
  Given:   %s

Please provide a value for this policy, or remove it.
#
[insufficient-cpus]
An insufficient number of CPUs was found while attempting to map the job
using the given request:

  Mapping policy:  %s
  Default cpuset:  %s
  CPU list:        %s
  Available CPUs:  %s

Please modify either the external limit set by the resource manager (e.g.,
cgroup), the default cpuset specified, or the cpu list provided as the
mapping policy modifier.
#
[insufficient-cpus-per-proc]
A request was made to bind a given number of cpus to each process, but
not enough cpus are available to meet the request:

  Binding policy:  %s
  Node:            %s
  CPU envelope:    %s
  CPUs per proc:   %d

Please adjust your request and try again.
[invalid-value]
A %s was given that requires a value, but the provided value is invalid:

  Policy:  %s
  Given:   %s

Please provide a valid value for this policy, or remove it.
#
[rankfile-no-filename]
The request to map processes using a rankfile could not be completed
because the filename of the rankfile was not specified. Please 
specify the name of the rankfile.
#
[missing-modifier]
A ':' was found in a modifier specification but there is no modifier
following the ':'. Please specify a modifier.
#
[invalid-combination]
We cannot bind to hardware threads if we are not treating hardware
threads as independent CPUs since the lowest allocatable unit is
"core" by default. In order to bind to hardware threads, you must
therefore specify that we treat hardware threads as independent CPUs
by adding the "HWTCPUS" modifier to the "--map-by" directive.

The combination "--map-by core:hwtcpus --bind-to hwthread" or
"--map-by :hwtcpus --bind-to hwthread" will result in one process
being placed on each core, with the process bound to the first
hardware thread in that core.

In contrast, a case such as "--map-by package:hwtcpus --bind-to hwthread"
would result in each process being bound to successive hardware threads
on each package.
#
[unrecognized-qualifier]
The %s directive contains an unrecognized qualifier:

  Qualifier: %s
  Valid qualifiers: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the qualifier is a supported one.
#
[unrecognized-directive]
The specified %s directive is not recognized:

  Directive: %s
  Valid directives: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the directive is a supported one.
#
[missing-qualifier]
The %s option contains a directive that is missing a value:

  Directive: %s
  Valid directive: "%s=<value>"

Please check for a typo or ensure that the value is provided.
#
[missing-personality]
PRRTE has hit an internal problem that should never happen - it is
attempting to map a job that lacks an assigned personality.

  Job: %s

Please report this to the PRRTE developers (https://github.com/openpmix/prrte/issues)
#
[unsupported-combination]
A %s policy was provided that is not supported in combination
with the "PE=N" option:

  Policy:  %s

When specifying the number of CPUs to use for each process in a job,
the processes must be bound at the CPU level - either HWThread if
"HWTCPUS" was specified, or CORE. Please remove the bind policy
specification and try again.
#
[unsupported-mapping-combo]
A mapping policy was provided that is not supported in combination
with the "PE-LIST=x,y,z" option:

  Policy:  %s

When specifying the CPUs to be used for the job, the mapper can
only look at those CPUs. It is therefore not possible to map
the job according to some other target object. Please either
remove the mapping policy or change it to "slot" and try again.
#
[map-by-option]
Processes are mapped in a round-robin fashion based on
one of the following directives as applied at the job level:

-   SLOT assigns procs to each node up to the number of available
    slots on that node before moving to the next node in the
    allocation

-   HWTHREAD assigns a proc to each hardware thread on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   CORE (default) assigns a proc to each core on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   L1CACHE assigns a proc to each L1 cache on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   L2CACHE assigns a proc to each L2 cache on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   L3CACHE assigns a proc to each L3 cache on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   NUMA assigns a proc to each NUMA region on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   PACKAGE assigns a proc to each package on a node in a
    round-robin manner up to the number of available slots on that
    node before moving to the next node in the allocation

-   NODE assigns processes in a round-robin fashion to all nodes
    in the allocation, with the number assigned to each node capped
    by the number of available slots on that node

-   SEQ (often accompanied by the file=<path> qualifier) assigns
    one process to each node specified in the file. The sequential
    file is to contain an entry for each desired process, one per
    line of the file.

-   PPR:N:resource maps N procs to each instance of the specified
    resource type in the allocation

-   RANKFILE (often accompanied by the file=<path> qualifier) assigns
    one process to the node/resource specified in each entry of the
    file, one per line of the file.

-   PE-LIST=a,b assigns procs to each node in the allocation based on
    the ORDERED qualifier. The list is comprised of comma-delimited
    ranges of CPUs to use for this job. If the ORDERED qualifier is not
    provided, then each node will be assigned procs up to the number of
    available slots, capped by the availability of the specified CPUs.
    If ORDERED is given, then one proc will be assigned to each of the
    specified CPUs, if available, capped by the number of slots on each
    node and the total number of specified processes. Providing the
    OVERLOAD qualifier to the "bind-to" option removes the check on
    availability of the CPU in both cases.

Any directive can include qualifiers by adding a colon (:) and any
combination of one or more of the following to the --map-by option
(except where noted):

-   PE=n bind n processing elements to each process (can not be
    used in combination with rankfile or pe-list directives)

-   SPAN load balance the processes across the allocation by treating
    the allocation as a single "super-node" (can not be used in
    combination with slot, node, seq, ppr, rankfile, or
    pe-list directives)

-   OVERSUBSCRIBE allow more processes on a node than processing elements
-   NOOVERSUBSCRIBE means !OVERSUBSCRIBE

-   NOLOCAL do not launch processes on the same node as prun

-   HWTCPUS use hardware threads as CPU slots

-   CORECPUS use cores as CPU slots (default)

-   INHERIT
-   NOINHERIT means !INHERIT

-   FILE=<path> (path to file containing sequential or rankfile entries).

-   ORDERED only applies to the PE-LIST option to indicate that procs
    are to be bound to each of the specified CPUs in the order
    in which they are assigned (i.e., the first proc on a node shall
    be bound to the first CPU in the list, the second proc shall be
    bound to the second CPU, etc.)

-   DISPLAY outputs a table showing the mapped location of each process
    prior to launch.

-   DISPLAYALLOC outputs the detected allocation of resources (e.g., nodes,
    slots) for the job

-   DONOTLAUNCH directs PRRTE to map by not launch the specified job.
    This is provided to help explore possible process placement patterns
    before actually starting execution.

Note that directives and qualifiers are case-insensitive
and can be shortened to the minimum number of characters
to uniquely identify them. Thus, "L1CACHE" can be given
as "l1cache" or simply as "L1".

A more detailed description of the mapping, ranking, and binding procedure
can be obtained via the "--help placement" option.
#
[rank-by-option]
By default, process ranks are assigned in accordance with the mapping
directive - e.g., jobs that are mapped by-node will have the process
ranks assigned round-robin on a per-node basis. However, users can override
the default by specifying any of the following directives using the
--rank-by command line option:

-   SLOT assigns ranks to each process on a node in the order in
    which the mapper assigned them. This is the default behavior,
    but is provided as an explicit option to allow users to override
    any alternative default specified in the environment. When mapping
    to a specific resource type, procs assigned to a given instance
    of that resource on a node will be ranked on a per-resource basis
    on that node before moving to the next node.

-   NODE assigns ranks round-robin on a per-node basis

-   FILL assigns ranks to procs mapped to a particular resource type
    on each node, filling all ranks on that resource before moving to
    the next resource on that node. For example, procs mapped by-L1cache
    would have all procs on the first L1cache ranked sequentially before
    moving to the second L1cache on the node. Once all procs on the
    node have been ranked, ranking would continue on the next node.

-   SPAN assigns ranks round-robin to procs mapped to a particular
    resource type, treating the collection of resource instances
    spanning the entire allocation as a single "super node" before
    looping around for the next pass. Thus, ranking would begin with
    the first proc on the first L1cache on the first node, then the
    next rank would be assiged to the first proc on the second L1cache
    on that node, proceeding across until the first proc had been
    ranked on all L1caches used by the job before circling around to
    rank the second proc on each object.

The rank-by command line option has no qualifiers. Note that directives
are case-insensitive.

A more detailed description of the mapping, ranking, and binding procedure
can be obtained via the "--help placement" option.
#
[must-map-by-obj]
When ranking by FILL or by SPAN, you must map by an object
type (e.g., HWTHREAD, NUMA, or cache level):

  Map policy:   %s
  Rank policy:  %s

Please specify a supported combination and try again.
#
[out-of-resource]
Either there are not enough slots available in the system to launch
the %d processes that were requested by the application, or there are
not enough CPUs to bind them as requested:

  App: %s
  Mapping: %s
  Binding: %s

Either request fewer processes for your application, make more slots
available for use by expanding the allocation, or do not bind the
processes so that the number of CPUs is no longer a limiting factor.

A "slot" is the PRRTE term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which PRRTE processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, PRRTE defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want PRRTE to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --map-by :OVERSUBSCRIBE option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch. Similarly, you can use the --bind-to :OVERLOAD option to bind
more than one process to a CPU, if desired, or --bind-to NONE to avoid
binding altogether.
