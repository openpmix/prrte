[prte-rmaps-rr:not-enough-cpus]
There are not enough slots available in the system or not enough
CPUs in the specified PE-LIST to map the number of processes requested
by the application:

  app:  %s
  Number of procs: %d
  pe-list: %s

Either request fewer procs for your application, make more slots
available for use, or expand the pe-list.

A "slot" is the PRRTE term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which PRRTE processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, PRRTE defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want PRRTE to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --map-by :OVERSUBSCRIBE option to ignore
the number of available slots and size of the pe-list when placing the
processes.
