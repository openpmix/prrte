[agent-not-found]
The value of the MCA parameter "plm_ssh_agent" was set to a path
that could not be found:

  plm_ssh_agent: %s

Please either unset the parameter, or check that the path is correct
#
[concurrency-less-than-zero]
The value of the MCA parameter "pls_ssh_num_concurrent" is less than
or equal to zero (%d).  This parameter is used to determine how many
remote agents (typically ssh) to invoke concurrently while launching
parallel jobs.

This value has automatically be reset to 1; processing will continue.
#
[deadlock-params]
The ssh launcher has been given a number of %d concurrent daemons to
launch and is in a debug-daemons option. However, the total number of
daemons to launch (%d) is greater than this value. This is a scenario that
will cause the system to deadlock.

To avoid deadlock, either increase the number of concurrent daemons, or
remove the debug-daemons flag.
#
[cmd-line-too-long]
The cmd line to launch remote daemons is too long:

  Length:      %d
  Max length:  %d

Consider setting -mca plm_ssh_pass_environ_mca_params 0 to
avoid including any environmentally set MCA parameters on the
command line.
