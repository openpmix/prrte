[no-available-pls]
No available launching agents were found.

This is an unusual error; it means that PRTE was unable to find
any mechanism to launch proceses, and therefore is unable to start the
process(es) required by your application.
#
[multiple-prefixes]
%s does not support multiple different %s options.  You can
specify at most one unique value for the %s option (in any of
the application contexts); it will be applied to all the application
contexts of your parallel job.

Put simply, you must have %s installed in the same location on
all of your nodes.

The first two %s values supplied were:
    %s
    %s

Please correct this and try again.
#
[multiple-app-prefixes]
%s does not support multiple different %s options for a given
application context.  You can specify at most one unique value
for the option.

Put simply, you must have PMIx installed in the same location on
all of your nodes.

The first two %s values supplied were:
    %s
    %s

Please correct this and try again.
#
[multiple-prrte-prefixes]
%s does not support multiple different prefix settings across the
various methods for specifying it.

Put simply, you must have PRRTE installed in the same location on
all of your nodes.

If multiple values are given (e.g., in the environment plus on the
cmd line), a precedence order is used to try and select between them:

* the cmd line value from "--prefix" overrides all others. You can
  have multiple cmd line entries, but they must all match or else
  an error will be generated.

* the configuration option --enable-prte-prefix-by-default takes
  next precedence

* the "PRTE_PREFIX" environment variable

* use of a fully-qualified absolute path to %s. The path is
  extracted from the cmd and used as the prefix value. Note that
  we do permit the path to be different from the prefix specified
  by other means. This is done for those situations where the
  library was installed in a different location on remote nodes
  from the local node where %s is being executed.

%s has detected that the prefix was specified in multiple ways,
and that the values given were different. The first two values
supplied were:

    %s
    %s

Please correct this and try again.
#
[multiple-pmix-prefixes]
%s does not support multiple different prefix settings across the
various methods for specifying it.

Put simply, you must have PMIx installed in the same location on
all of your nodes.

If multiple values are given (e.g., in the environment plus on the
cmd line), a precedence order is used to try and select between them:

* the cmd line value from "--pmix-prefix" overrides all others. You can
  have multiple cmd line entries, but they must all match or else
  an error will be generated.

* the "PMIX_PREFIX" environment variable

%s has detected that the prefix was specified in multiple ways,
and that the values given were different. The first two values
supplied were:

    %s
    %s

Please correct this and try again.
#
[prefix-conflict]
%s was given two conflicting directives regarding a prefix value
for an application context:

    %s: %s
    %s

We cannot execute both of those, so please correct this and
try again.
#
[multi-endian]
PRRTE does not currently support multi-endian operations. We have
detected that the following node differs in endianness:


  Nodename:      %s
  Endian:        %s
  Local endian:  %s

Please correct the situation and try again.
