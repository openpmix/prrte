[stacktrace signal override]

PRTE was inserting a signal handler for signal %d but noticed that
there is already a non-default handler installed.  PRTE's handler was
therefore not installed; your job will continue.  This warning message
will only be displayed once, even if PRTE encounters this situation
again.

To avoid displaying this warning message, you can either not install
the error handler for signal %d or you can have PRTE not try to
install its own signal handler for this signal by setting the
"prte_signals" MCA parameter.

   Signal: %d
   Current prte_signal value: %s
#
[stacktrace bad signal]

PRTE was inserting a signal handler but was given an invalid signal
number:

   Signal string: %s
   Bad value:     %s

The given value must be an integer within the signal number range.
Please correct the value and try again.
#
[malformed-uri]

PRTE has detected a malformed URI:

   URI:  %s

Accepted values follow IETF RFC3986, e.g.
"file://192.168.1.1/over/there"
#
[relative-path]

When creating a URI, all files must be specified in absolute paths:

   Value provided: %s

Please update your application to provide the full path to the file.
#
[sys-limit-failed]

Per request, PRTE attempted to set a system resource limit to a given
value:

   Resource:  %s
   Limit:     %s

The system has refused to allow this operation. This is likely due to
a permission limitation, or specifying an unsupported value. Please
check the system or remove the request and try again.
#
[sys-limit-unrecognized]

PRTE received a request to set a system resource limit. Sadly, OMPI
does not recognize or currently support the specified resource:

   Resource:  %s
   Limit:     %s

Please correct the request and try again.
