[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.


Hello, world
============

[help]

Help can be requested in three ways:

1. A directive to the cmd. For example, the command

      "%s --help" or "%s -h"

   will provide the high-level help output giving a general
   description of each available option.

2. An option to the help directive. For example, the command

      "%s --help foo" or "%s -h foo"

   will provide detailed help about the "foo" command line directive.

3. Specifying "help" as an option to the directive of interest. For
   example, the command

      "%s --foo --help" or "%s --foo -h"

   will provide detailed help about the "foo" command line directive.
   Note that the "help" and "h" options do not require the dash
   prefixes â€” i.e., the following commands

      "%s --foo help" or "%s --foo h"

   will also output detailed help for "foo". Thus, directives are
   precluded from defining options of "help" and "h".

Note that the last two methods are functionally equivalent and will
return the same output.

[unknown-option]

Help was requested for an unknown option:

   Option: %s

Please use the "%s --help" command to obtain a list of all supported
options.

[unrecognized-option]

The help system for %s does not recognize the following:

   Option: %s

This might require help from the developers.

[version]

Print version and exit

[verbose]

Enable debug options - number of times specified sets level of
verbosity (e.g., "-vvv" => 3rd level of debug information)

[quiet]

Suppress helpful messages

[parsable]

When used in conjunction with other parameters, output information
(e.g., help messages) is displayed in a machine-parsable format

[parseable]

When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output information
(e.g., help messages) is displayed in a machine-parsable format

[short-no-long]

A short option was provided to %s and recognized by the parser, but
has no matching long option:

   Short option: %s

This might require help from the developers.

[unregistered-option]

An unrecognized option was included on the %s command line:

   Option: %s

Please use the "%s --help" command to obtain a list of all supported
options.
