[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.

Report bugs to %s

[version]

%s (%s) %s

Report bugs to %s

[dvm-master-uri]

Specify the URI of the DVM master, or the name of the file (specified
as "file:filename") that contains that info

[test-suicide]

Test DVM cleanup upon daemon failure by having one daemon suicide
after delay

[system-server]

Start the daemon as the system server on its node

[set-sid]

Direct the daemon to separate from the current session

[prtemca]

Pass a PRRTE MCA parameter.

Syntax: "--prtemca <key> <value>", where "key" is the parameter name
and "value" is the parameter value.

[pmixmca]

Pass a PMIx MCA parameter

Syntax: "--pmixmca <key> <value>", where "key" is the parameter name
and "value" is the parameter value.

[leave-session-attached]

Do not discard stdout/stderr of remote PRRTE daemons. The primary use
for this option is to ensure that the daemon output streams (i.e.,
stdout and stderr) remain open after launch, thus allowing the user to
see any daemon-generated error messages. Otherwise, the daemon will
"daemonize" itself upon launch, thereby closing its output streams.

[parent-uri]

Specify the URI of the prted acting as the parent of this prted in a
tree-based spawn operation

[tree-spawn]

A tree-based spawn operation is in progress

[pubsub-server]

Contact information for external PRRTE publish/lookup data server

%s

[prted:environ]

PRTE Daemon was unable to set

   %s = %s

in the environment. Returned value %d instead of PRTE_SUCCESS.

[prted:init-failure]

PRTE was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to %s.  Returned value %d instead of PRTE_SUCCESS.

[prted:cannot-bind]

A request was made to bind the PRTE daemons to a core that does not
exist on this node:

   node:  %s
   cores: %s

The MCA param directing this behavior is prte_daemon_cores. Please
correct the request and try again.

[cwd]

A dynamic operation (%s) was requested that requires us to obtain the
current working directory. Unfortunately, an error was returned when
we attempted to obtain it:

   error: %d

We are unable to complete the requested operation.

[bad-key]

A dynamic operation (%s) was requested that included an unrecognized
info key:

   group: %s
   key:   %s

The operation will continue, but may not behave completely as
expected.

[timedout]

A request has timed out and will therefore fail:

   Operation:  %s

Your job may terminate as a result of this problem. You may want to
adjust the MCA parameter pmix_server_max_wait and try again. If this
occurred during a connect/accept operation, you can adjust that time
using the pmix_base_exchange_timeout parameter.

[noroom]

A request for an asynchronous runtime operation cannot be fulfilled
because of a lack of room in the tracking array:

   Operation:  %s
   Number of rooms:  %d

This is usually caused by a large job that encounters significant
delays across the cluster when starting the application processes.
Your job may terminate as a result of this problem. You may want to
adjust the MCA parameter "pmix_server_max_reqs" and try again.

[noserver]

A publish/lookup server was provided, but we were unable to connect to
it — please check the connection info and ensure the server is alive:

   Connection:  %s

[mpir-debugger-detected]

PRRTE has detected that you have attached a debugger to this MPI job,
and that debugger is using the legacy "MPIR" method of attachment.

Please note that PRRTE has deprecated the "MPIR" debugger attachment
method in favor of the new "PMIx" debugger attchment mechanisms.

Warning:

  This means that future versions of PRRTE may not support the "MPIR"
  debugger attachment method at all. Specifically: the debugger you
  just attached may not work with future versions of PRTE.

You may wish to contact your debugger vendor to inquire about support
for PMIx-based debugger attachment mechanisms. Meantime, you can
disable this warning by setting the "OMPI_MPIR_DO_NOT_WARN"
environment variable to 1.

[both-file-and-dir-set]

Both the "output-directory" and "output-filename" options have been
set:

   Directory:      %s
   Filename:       %s

Only one of these can be set — please fix the options and try again.

[min-pmix-violation]

PRRTE has detected that the PMIx library being used to run this
executable does not meet the minimum supported version:

   Min PMIx version: %0x Detected version: %0x

Please check your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ensure we are pointed to a
version that meets the minimum requirement.
