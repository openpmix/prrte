[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.


Hello, world
============

[no-hostfile]

PRTE was unable to open the hostfile:

   %s

Check to make sure the path and filename are correct.

[port]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The port parameter is less than 0:

   port=%d

[slots]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The slots parameter is less than 0:

   slots=%d

[max_slots]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The max_slots parameter is less than 0:

   max_slots=%d

[max_slots_lt]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The max_slots parameter is less than the slots parameter:

   slots=%d
   max_slots=%d

[parse_error_string]

PRTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:

   %s

It occured on line number %d on token %d:

   %s

[parse_error_int]

PRTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:

   %s

It occured on line number %d on token %d:

   %d

[parse_error]

PRTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:

   %s

It occured on line number %d on token %d.

[not-all-mapped-alloc]

Some of the requested hosts are not included in the current
allocation.

The requested hosts were in this hostfile:

      %s

Please verify that you have specified the allocated resources properly
in the provided hostfile.

[hostfile:relative-syntax]

A relative host was specified, but no prior allocation has been made.
Thus, there is no way to determine the proper host to be used.

   hostfile entry: %s

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[hostfile:relative-node-not-found]

A relative host was specified, but was not found. The requested host
was specified as:

   Index: %d
   Syntax given: %s

This is most likely due to the relative index being out of bounds. You
could obtain a larger allocation or reduce the relative host index.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[hostfile:invalid-relative-node-syntax]

A relative host was improperly specified — the value provided was.

   hostfile entry: %s

You may have forgotten to preface a node with "N" or "n", or used the
"e" or "E" to indicate empty nodes.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[hostfile:not-enough-empty]

The requested number of empty hosts was not available — the system was
short by %d hosts.  Please recheck your allocation.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[boards]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The boards parameter is less than 0:

   boards=%d

[sockets]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The packages parameter is less than 0:

   packages=%d

[cores]

PRTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:

   %s

The cores parameter is less than 0:

   cores=%d

[hostfile:extra-node-not-found]

A hostfile was provided that contains at least one node not present in
the allocation:

   hostfile:  %s
   node:      %s

If you are operating in a resource-managed environment, then only
nodes that are in the allocation can be used in the hostfile. You may
find relative node syntax to be a useful alternative to specifying
absolute node names; re-run this command with "--help hosts" for
further information.

[slots-given]

A hostfile was provided that contains multiple definitions of the slot
count for at least one node:

   hostfile:  %s
   node:      %s

You can either list a node multiple times, once for each slot, or you
can provide a single line that contains "slot=N". Mixing the two
methods is not supported.

Please correct the hostfile and try again.
