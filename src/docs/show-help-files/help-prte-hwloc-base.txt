[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.


Hello, world
============

[mbind failure]

PRTE failed to bind internal memory to a specific NUMA node.  This
message will only be reported at most once per process.

   Local host: %s
   PID:        %d
   File:       %s:%d
   Message:    %s
   Severity:   %s

[invalid binding_policy]

The specified %s policy is not recognized:

   Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported one.

[redefining-policy]

Conflicting directives for binding policy are causing the policy to be
redefined:

   New policy:   %s
   Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.

[deprecated]

The following command line option and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

   Command line option:
     Deprecated:  %s
     Replacement: %s

   Equivalent MCA parameter:
     Deprecated:  %s
     Replacement: %s

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of PRTE.
Please update to the new syntax.

[obj-idx-failed]

PRTE failed to find a cache of a specified type.  This is a highly
unusual error; it may indicate a system configuration error.  This
additional information may be of help:

   Message:     %s
   Cache level: %d

[missing-cpulist]

The following binding modifier was given but lacks a required value:

   Modifier: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported one.

[bad-processor-type]

The default CPU list contains an invalid modifier:

   Default CPU list:  %s
   Modifier:  %s

The modifier should indicate the type of CPU being used in the list —
the only valid values are HWTCPUS (for use of hwthreads as independent
CPUs) or CORECPUS (for use of cores as independent CPUs). Please
correct the input.

[unrecognized-modifier]

The binding request contains an unrecognized modifier:

   Request: %s

Please check your request and try again.

[bind-upwards]

Binding is performed to the first available specified object type
within the object where the process was mapped. In other words,
binding can only be done to the mapped object or to a resource located
beneath that object.

The specified binding lies above the mapping object type:

   Mapping level: %s
   Binding level: %s

Please correct the map/bind directives and try again.
