[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.


Hello, world
============

[not-all-mapped-alloc]

At least one of the requested hosts is not included in the current
allocation.

   Missing requested host: %s

Please check your allocation or your request.

[dash-host:relative-syntax]

A relative host was specified, but no prior allocation has been made.
Thus, there is no way to determine the proper host to be used.

   --host: %s

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[dash-host:relative-node-not-found]

A relative host was specified, but was not found. The requested host
was specified with "--host" as:

   Index: %d
   Syntax given: %s

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[dash-host:relative-node-out-of-bounds]

A relative host was specified, but the index given is beyond the
number of hosts in the current allocation:

   Index: %d
   #hosts: %d

You could obtain a larger allocation or reduce the relative host
index.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[dash-host:invalid-relative-node-syntax]

A relative host was improperly specified — the value provided was.

   --host: %s

You may have forgotten to preface a node with "N" or "n", or used the
"e" or "E" to indicate empty nodes.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.

[dash-host:not-enough-empty]

The requested number of empty hosts was not available — the system was
short by %d hosts.  Please recheck your allocation.

Re-run this command with "--help hosts" for further information.
