#
[prte_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like prte_init failed for some reason. There are many reasons
that can cause PRRTE to fail during prte_init, some of which are due to
configuration or environment problems.  This failure appears to be an
internal failure - here's some additional information (which may only
be relevant to a PRRTE developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %s (%d) instead of PRTE_SUCCESS
#
#
[prte:session:dir:prohibited]
The specified location for the temporary directories required by PRTE
is on the list of prohibited locations:

Location given: %s
Prohibited locations: %s

If you believe this is in error, please contact your system administrator
to have the list of prohibited locations changed. Otherwise, please identify
a different location to be used (use -h to see the cmd line option), or
simply let the system pick a default location.
#
[prte:session:dir:nopwname]
PRTE was unable to obtain the username in order to create a path
for its required temporary directories.  This type of error is usually
caused by a transient failure of network-based authentication services
(e.g., LDAP or NIS failure due to network congestion), but can also be
an indication of system misconfiguration.

Please consult your system administrator about these issues and try
again.
#
[prte_nidmap:too_many_nodes]
An error occurred while trying to pack the information about the job. More nodes
have been found than the %d expected. Please check your configuration files such
as the mapping.
#
[prte_init:startup:num_daemons]
PRTE was unable to determine the number of nodes in your allocation. We
are therefore assuming a very large number to ensure you receive proper error
messages.
#
[failed-to-uncompress]
A compressed message was received that could not be
decompressed. This is most likely due to a missing
libz library on the receiving node:

  node:  %s

Please ensure that the libz library is present on all
compute nodes.
#
[bootstrap-not-found]
Bootstrap startup was requested, but the required configuration
file was not found on at least one node:

  node: %s
  file: %s

Please ensure the file has been installed in the correct location
on every node included in this PRRTE DVM.
#
[bootstrap-missing-field-name]
Bootstrap startup was requested, but the required configuration
file on at least one node is missing the field name on an entry:

  node: %s
  file: %s
  line: %s

Please correct the line.
#
[bootstrap-missing-value]
Bootstrap startup was requested, but the required configuration
file on at least one node is missing a value on an entry:

  node: %s
  file: %s
  line: %s

Please correct the line.
#
[bootstrap-missing-entry]
Bootstrap startup was requested, but the required configuration
file on at least one node is missing a required entry:

  node:   %s
  file:   %s
  entry:  %s

Please provide the missing information.
#
[bootstrap-bad-nodelist]
Bootstrap startup was requested, but we were unable to parse
the regex of participating nodes on at least one node:

  node:   %s
  file:   %s
  regex:  %s
  error:  %s

Please fix the error and try again.
