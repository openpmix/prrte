Overview
========

While PRRTE does not itself contain a scheduler, it does support scheduler-related
operations as a means of providing users and researchers with an environment within
which they can investigate/explore dynamic operations. It will , of course, interact
with any PMIx-based scheduler to support allocation requests and directives for
executing jobs within an allocation.
