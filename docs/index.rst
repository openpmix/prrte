PMIx Reference Runtime Environment (PRRTE) |prte_ver|
=====================================================

The project is formally referred to in documentation by "PRRTE", and
the GitHub repository is ``prrte``.

However, we have found that most users do not like typing the two
consecutive ``r`` letters in the name. Hence, all of the internal API symbols,
environment variables, MCA frameworks, and CLI executables all use the
abbreviated ``prte`` (one ``r``, not two) for convenience.
