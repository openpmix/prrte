PRRTE DVM Configuration Tool
============================

.. This rst file exists solely so that Sphinx generates a document
   named "configurator" that can be referenced by the top-level TOC.
   In the rendered HTML tree, this file will be overwritten by the
   _templates/configurator.html templated file.

   Note, however, that even though the entire contents of this file at
   effectively ignored, this file *does* need to have a valid title so
   that it can be rendered in the TOC.
